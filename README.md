# Karben - Dotnet Core 3.1

Failed start of a game, thought way too hard about this just for it to wither and die lmao. The telegram, and procedural dungeon part actually work which is neat, but nothing else really does. The project does build if you wanna see it.

## Basic Usage / Requirements

Make an App.config file and add the following:

```cs
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="telegramKey" value="telegramkey"/>
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```
